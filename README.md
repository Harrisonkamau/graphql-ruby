# To run your server:

Note: (use `bin/rails` instead of `rails`: so as to use the application's Rails version)
```ruby
bin/rails s
```

To run query the API, have either of the following installed:
1. [GraphQL App](https://electronjs.org/apps/graphiql)
2. [GraphQL IDE](https://github.com/andev-software/graphql-ide)


This tutorial uses GraphQL APP.

Note: *GraphQL only has one endpoint*: `localhost:{port}/graphql`

The `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` requests are referred to as [mutations](https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-ruby/3-mutations/) in GraphQL.
